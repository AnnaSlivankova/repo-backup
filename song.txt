Heal my heart
Beg my way
Oh I've got what I made of porcelain
You're smoking my dope
Let me fuck with you
Is that what you want?
Even if it rips you apart?
So, drive slow, drive slow
Let me see your face
Let me see it glow
Don't stop, don't stop
I wanna hide forever in your heart
Drive slow, drive slow
Let me see your face
Let me see it glow
Don't stop, don't stop
I wanna hide forever in your heart

We're just humans, nothing more
I wish it wasn't looking
'Cause we're haunted
'Cause we're haunted
We're just humans, nothing more
I wish it wasn't looking
'Cause we're haunted
'Cause we're haunted
'Cause we're haunted
'Cause we're haunted
